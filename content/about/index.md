Based in Wickham Bishops in Essex, I am currently a Senior consultant working for Contino Solutions. I've been working in IT since 2013 when I transferred from working on my Fintech employer's Customer Support helpdesk over to Operations because "Linux seems interesting". I moved into my first proper DevOps Engineering role in October 2018 working with Terraform, AWS and Ansible, and then joined Contino as a consultant in September 2019. I now help Enterprise customers with their digital transformation projects, implementing scaleable, resilient and (where possible) automated solutions to address customer needs and enable them to meet their business goals.

Outside of work I am a husband to Cathy, father to Lily, dog owner to Archie (a black Labradoodle) and keen gamer. I love taking holidays in the Lake District to get away from technology once in a while, and am currently renovating our family house with some much needed modern updates after it was somewhat neglected by the previous owners. I also play bass guitar (badly), although COVID is giving me lots of time to practice!
