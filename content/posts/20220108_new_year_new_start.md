New Years resolution #1: Add meaningful content to this blog! 2021 turned out to be a crazy year, getting the house renovated took months and ended up with us staying at the in-laws and using a local shared workspace. I also left Contino and consultancy and moved back into a purely engineering role at Lucid LLC, who were then bought out only 3 months later by the Swedish-based Cint group so let's see how that goes!

In terms of tech stuff I really made an effort to sort out the newtorking in the new house so I'll probably post a bit about that, I'm working on a lot more Kubernetes stuff in my new role so will definitely be posting up about my path to get K8s-certified, and I really feel like this is the year to start formalising and mastering Python so I'll probably put up some articles about that as well.

If you've made it here then I hope this post finds you well, look forwards to further updates!
