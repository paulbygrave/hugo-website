      <description>Based in Wickham Bishops in Essex, I am currently a Senior consultant working for Contino Solutions. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in IT since 2013 when I transferred from working on my Fintech employer&amp;rsquo;s Customer Support helpdesk over to Operations because &amp;ldquo;Linux seems interesting&amp;rdquo;. I moved into my first proper DevOps Engineering role in October 2018 working with Terraform, AWS and Ansible, and then joined Contino as a consultant in September 2019. I now help Enterprise customers with their digital transformation projects, implementing scaleable, resilient and (where possible) automated solutions to address customer needs and enable them to meet their business goals.</description>
